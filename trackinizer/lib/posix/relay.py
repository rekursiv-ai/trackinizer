"""Attach a human's own terminal to a child running on a pseudo-terminal.

:class:`~trackinizer.lib.posix.terminal.Terminal` owns a child nobody is watching.
A relay puts a person in front of it: keystrokes go down to the child, the
child's painting comes back up, and the real terminal is borrowed for the
child's lifetime -- raw mode on, window size forwarded, both handed back on
the way out.

Byte-transparent in both directions, so the child renders exactly as if it had
been run directly, while a program still holds the master fd and can type into
it. That is the whole point: a message spliced into a live session must be
indistinguishable, to the child, from something the human typed.

Handing the terminal back is three separate undos, and they are ordered:

1. Window-size and interrupt handlers are released.
2. DECSET emulator modes the child left on are disabled -- while the child is
   provably gone, so it cannot repaint them.
3. Line discipline is restored with ``tcsetattr``.

Step 2 cannot follow step 3: those modes live in the terminal emulator, not
the line discipline, so once raw mode is gone there is nothing left to write
the disables through.
