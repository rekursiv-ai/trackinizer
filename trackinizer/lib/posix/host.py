"""Serve a child on a pty to terminals that attach, detach, and come back.

A :class:`~trackinizer.lib.posix.relay.Relay` lends the child ONE terminal -- the one
that started it -- and the child dies with it: close the laptop and the agent
is gone. A host lends it none. The child's output goes to a durable scrollback
file and to whichever viewers are attached at the moment, and its input comes
from them over a Unix socket, so a viewer is any process that can connect, as
many times as it likes, from any terminal.

That is the part of tmux a long-running agent needs, without a tmux server and
its own socket naming, whose path limit has failed a launch outright.

The socket carries :class:`Frame` records -- a five-byte header and a payload:

- A viewer sends ``ATTACH`` and receives the recent output as one replay, then
  every later chunk as it is written. ``INPUT`` carries its keystrokes and
  ``RESIZE`` its geometry.
- Any client may ``SUBMIT`` a message, answered with ``ACK``, or ``STOP`` the
  child. Every client still connected when the child exits receives ``EXIT``
  with its status.
